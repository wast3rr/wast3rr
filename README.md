### Hello, friend

🎓 I'm currently a student at Rutgers University studying CS, graduating 2025
👔 I'm an incoming Summer 2025 TIP for Capital One
🖥️ My most familiar language is Python, however I have experience in C, Java, JS, and Rust
💽 I'm interested in many different fields but primarily backend dev, systems programming, and security engineering
✍🏼 I'm currently studying Cybersecurity outside of my degree and studying to get my Sec+
🤠 Outside of tech I enjoy watching/reviewing films, playing video games, going to the gym, and reading philosophy/sociology books

Feel free to reach out to collaborate or chat.
